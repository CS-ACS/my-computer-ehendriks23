## Commentary
* I got this laptop around a year ago and I think it's kind of average, nothing too extreme like a gaming laptop, but it can still comfortably work. It also has a dedicated GPU, making it slightly better for games.
* It's a Windows laptop, which is probably the most observable aspect mentioned above. I've never really used a Mac or MacOS, so I'm pretty comfortable with Windows. In terms of ports, I have quite a few which is useful for plugging in external devices like mice or keyboards. 8 GB of RAM is alright for working, but when playing video games, my laptop can run slow sometimes.
